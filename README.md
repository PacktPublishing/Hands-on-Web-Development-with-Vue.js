## Notes from the Author:

### How to use this repository

This repositroy includes all important source code files the video course.
Let me guide you through this, so you know what's up:

### Section 1

This is split up into all the individual folders.
Each contains the finished `index.html` with some comments dropped in to explain critical pieces.

### Section 2 - 6

These sections only focus on the application we were building over this course.
As we were using `vue-cli` to scaffold the project, I didn't put all those
auto generated files into the folders.

What you will find though is the content of the `src` folder.
The code in each folder always represents the final state at the end of the section.

So if you want to pick up at a later section, just drop the files into your own `src` folder,
and you can continue the next section from there.

### SETUP

This folder contains all the SETUP files that are referenced throughout the course.
Feel free to use them as explained in the videos.
